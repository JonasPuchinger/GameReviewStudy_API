# GameReviewStudy API

## Introduction

This project is the server backend of an online study on video game reviews conducted for the course "Advanced Usability Engineering", which is part of the masters program in media informatics at the [University of Regensburg](https://www.uni-regensburg.de/)

The aim of the study is to show how different CAPTCHAs are able to influence users to write reviews with friendlier tone and higher quality.

This part of the project serves as the backend, which connects the frontend to a connected Google Sheet.

The corresponding frontend can be found [here](https://github.com/JonasPuchinger/GameReviewStudy_APP).
